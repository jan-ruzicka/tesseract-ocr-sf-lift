# tesseract-ocr-sf-lift
This is a repository for settings used for converting of repository tesseract-ocr from CVS on SourceForge.net to Git.


The `make -f conversion.mk` should do the trick.

exceptions:

The `tesseract-ocr.cvs` needs to have last two lines removed to work as a fast-import for Git.
